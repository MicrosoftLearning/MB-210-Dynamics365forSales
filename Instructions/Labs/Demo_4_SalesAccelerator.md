### Demo 4: Work with the Sales accelerator

One of the sellers on your team has expressed difficulty making progress with a lead You want to help coach them on effective ways to improve their relationship with the customer and nurture the deal to a successful close. You suggest two ways to help the seller:

1) Monitor key performance metrics like relationship health score and predictive lead scoring
2) Create a sequence and add it to the seller's lead record to help the seller follow clear steps

First, let's use Sales Insights to discover key metrics about the customer.

1. Navigate to **Sales accelerator** in the left menu. This is the Sales accelerator workspace.

2. Look through the **work list** in the left side of the screen. The work list displays a list of records that are assigned to you or to a security role that you're part of. It offers a quick view of records to pay attention to.

3. Click the **filter** button and check **Unopened.**

4. Select the **Sort** button and select **Score.** Then select **Lowest on top.**

5. On each record in the work list, show the following:
    - Blue dot to denote it as unopened
    - The number of the lead score and corresponding color to represent its grade (green, yellow or orange)
    - The task beneath the Lead name with the option to call, mark as complete, cancel activity, or assign it to someone else
  
6. Select the lead for **Josiah Love.** Show how once the record in the work list is opened, it disappears from the view because it is no longer unopened.

7. On the Josiah Love lead record in the Sales accelerator workspace, show the following:
   - The Up Next widget, showing the next task and its due date.
   - The timeline.
   - The lead score. Hover over the factors below the lead score grade. Show the insights behind the lead scores.
   - Who knows whom. Switch to graph view.
   - Relationship health.
   
8. Switch to the **Relationship analytics** tab. Show the following:
   - Summary, with key insights computed from previous years.
   - Relationship health.
   - Client's contacts and your colleagues.
   - Customer interactions.
   - Hourly investment.
   - Email engagement.
   - Email send/receive ratio.
   - Relationship activities.
  
9. Let's take action on this lead to improve our predictive lead score.
    - Expand the **Qualify** stage of the business process flow.
    - Change Purchase Timeframe to **Next quarter.**
    - Change Estimated Budget to **40,000.**
    - Change Purchase Process to **Individual.**

10. Scores are refreshed every 24 hours, so you will not see the lead score update in real time. Congratulations! You have taken action to improve the lead score for this lead.
