## Demo 3 - Work with the opportunity pipeline view

Your manager indicates concern about some of your team's open opportunities having less than desirable predictive opportunity scores. You want to take a look at all the open opportunities and see a high-level view of their predictive scoring.

1. Navigate to **Opportunities.**

2. You will see the Opportunitiy pipeline view, which shows all open opportunities mapped on a graph. The x-axis shows the estimated close date and the y-axis shows the predictive opportunity score.

3. Each opportunity is mapped by a circle. The size of the circle represents the estimated revenue. The color of the circle represents the relationship health grade.

4. The opportunities most at risk are represented by the biggest orange circles closest to the axis intersection. Hover over the big orange circle at the bottom of the pipeline chart. The record name will appear and should read **2 Cafe Duo Espresso Machines for Fabrikam.**

5. The opportunity record will open in a pane on the right side of the screen. Here, we can easily view details about the opportunity, including the Contact, Purchase Process, Purchase Timeframe, and its associated Activities.

6. This pane can be customized to best fit your working style. Select the **Customize layout** button (looks like a magic wand). Toggle the radio buttons to customize your layout. When done, make sure **Compact header** is *off* and **Extended width** is *on.*

7. Details about the opportunity can be entered right here in the Opportunity pipeline view. Under the Purchase process field, change **Unknown** to **Committee.**

8. You just got a call that Fabrikam needs another 2 weeks to come to a decision. Let's track the incoming call as an activity, and then update the estimated close date.

9. Find the Timeline in the opportunity pane and click the plus sign to add an activity.

10. For subject, enter "Needs to delay close date."

11. Change the Direction to **Incoming.** The Call From and Call To fields will switch. Select **Save and close.**

12. Select the carrot next to the Owner field. Update the **Est. close date** to 2 weeks after the original date.

13. Click **Save.**

14. The opportunity pipeline view will update to reflect the new opportunity close date (the circle representing 2 Cafe Duo Machines for Fabrikam will move to the right).
