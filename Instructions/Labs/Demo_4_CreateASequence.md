One of the sellers on your team has expressed difficulty making contact with a lead. You want to help coach them on effective ways to improve their relationship with the customer and nurture the deal to a successful close. You suggest three ways to help the seller:

1) Create a sequence and add it to the seller's lead record to help the seller follow clear steps
2) Monitor key performance metrics like relationship health score and predictive lead scoring

### Task 1: Identify low-grade leads in the Sales Accelerator 

1. Navigate to **Sales accelerator** in the left menu. This is the Sales accelerator workspace.

2. Look through the **work list** in the left side of the screen. The work list displays a list of records that are assigned to you or to a security role that you're part of. It offers a quick view of records to pay attention to.

3. Click the **filter** button and check **Unopened.**

4. Select the **Sort** button and select **Score.** Then select **Lowest on top.**

5. On each record in the work list, show the following:
    - Blue dot to denote it as unopened
    - The number of the lead score and corresponding color to represent its grade (green, yellow or orange)
    - The task beneath the Lead name with the option to call, mark as complete, cancel activity, or assign it to someone else
  
6. Select the lead for **Josiah Love.** Show how once the record in the work list is opened, it disappears from the view because it is no longer unopened.

7. On the Josiah Love lead record in the Sales accelerator workspace, show the following:
   - The Up Next widget, showing the next task and its due date.
   - The timeline.
   - The lead score. Hover over the factors below the lead score grade. Show the insights behind the lead scores.
   - Who knows whom. Switch to graph view.
   - Relationship health.
   
8. Switch to the **Relationship analytics** tab. Show the following:
   - Summary, with key insights computed from previous years.
   - Relationship health.
   - Client's contacts and your colleagues.
   - Customer interactions.
   - Hourly investment.
   - Email engagement.
   - Email send/receive ratio.
   - Relationship activities.
  
9. Let's take action on this lead to improve our predictive lead score.
    - Expand the **Qualify** stage of the business process flow.
    - Change Purchase Timeframe to **Next quarter.**
    - Change Estimated Budget to **40,000.**
    - Change Purchase Process to **Individual.**

10. Scores are refreshed every 24 hours, so you will not see the lead score update in real time. Congratulations! You have taken action to improve the lead score for this lead.
  
### Task 2: Create new sequence

Your sales teammate expresses that when he's spoken with Josiah, Josiah has expressed that they prefer phone calls and meetings to emails. You decide that the existing sequence, which relies heavily on email communication, doesn't work for some customers. You decide to build a new sequence that focuses more on in-person selling styles. Instead of creating a new sequence from blank, you'll use the existing lead nurturing sequence, create a copy, and make edits.

1. Change the area to **Sales Insights settings** using the bottom left drop-down menu icon.

2. In the **Sales Insights** group, select **Global settings**.

3. In the **Sales accelerator** sub-group, select the **Sequences** tab.

4. If necessary, select **Enable** on the notification to enable workflow for sequences to work properly.

5. If necessary, select **Setup workspace**, then select **Quick setup**. Select **Publish** on the flyout pane.

5. Find the **New lead nurturing** sequence. This is the sequence currenly in use for lead records. Select the sequence and select **Create a copy.**

6. Under Sequence name, enter "In-person lead nurturing." In the Description, enter "Nurture outreach series for prospecting new leads, focusing on calls and meetings."

7. Select **Save and edit.**

### Task 3: Choose the first activity for seller to take

Let's take a look at the sequence and replace steps where sellers sent emails with calls or meetings.

1. Delete the first email step under **Sequence starts here.**

2. Select the plus sign to add a new step where the email step used to be. Select **Send a text message.**

3. Under Title, enter "Set up introduction call." Under Description, enter "Ask the customer for a good time that day to call."

4. Under that step, select the plus sign and add a new Phone call step.

5. Under Title, enter "Introduction call." Under "Description", enter "Introduce seller and product; assess customer needs."

6. Keep the Set wait time step.

7. Delete the Send a reminder email. Replace with a **Phone call** step titled "Follow-up call." In the description, enter "Follow up after initial introduction and schedule in-person meeting."

8. Add a step below Follow-up call to **Complete a task.** The title should be "Schedule meeting."

9. Leave the other steps the same.

10. **Save** the sequence.

11. **Activate** the sequence. (Check **I understand** if necessary.)

## Task 4: Connect the sequence to records

1. Change the area using the bottom left dropdown menu, select the **Sales** area. 

2. Select **Leads** from the site navigation menu.

3. Use the search bar to search for **Josiah Love.** You can start by typing in his first or last name.

4. Open the record.

5. Select **Connect sequence** from the command bar. The list of available sequences includes sequences created by you and other users for the **Lead** table.

6. Select the Sequence you created called "In-person lead nurturing." Select **Connect**.

7. A confirmation message appears at the bottom of the page, and the sequence is connected to the selected lead record. Now, sellers who have access to the lead record can see the activities connected with it.

8. Refresh the Up next widget. It should now read **Set up introduction call.**

9. Expand the step and mark as complete.

10. The next step, "Follow-up call," will appear in the Up next widget. There is a countdown to the time you need to complete.

11. Congratulations! You have made a new sequence and connected it to a record.
